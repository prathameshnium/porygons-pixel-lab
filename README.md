🧪 Porygon's Pixel Lab

A digital lab for generating publication-ready plots, figures, and animations with Python.

Welcome to Porygon's Pixel Lab! This repository is a personal workshop for creating beautiful, high-quality visuals for research, presentations, and academic papers. Just as Porygon is built from code, all visuals here are generated using Python scripts.
Also includes python macros for CAD(free CAD) models

Here are a few examples of visuals generated by this lab.

🛠️ Tools Used

This lab primarily runs on Python and a few key libraries:

Manim: For creating complex mathematical animations and concept explainers.

Matplotlib: For robust, publication-quality 2D and 3D data plots.

Seaborn: For high-level statistical data visualization.

Custom Python Scripts: Various self-made tools and helper functions to automate and streamline figure creation.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/porygons-pixel-lab.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/porygons-pixel-lab.git)
cd porygons-pixel-lab


Install dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file listing packages like manim, matplotlib, etc.)

Run a script:
Navigate to a project directory and execute the script.

For Manim:

cd manim/token_embedding
manim -pqm token_embedding.py TokenEmbeddingScene


For Matplotlib:

cd matplotlib/simple_line_plot
python line_plot.py
